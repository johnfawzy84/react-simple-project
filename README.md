# REACT SIMPLE VITJS BASED PROJECT WITH GITHUB ACTIONS & DOCKER IMAGE
The aim of this project is eductional. <br/>
I wanted to create a simple React-App that I can deploy on K8s.<br/>
Of course this would me that I need to create the needed Docker Container which will be orchstrated by K8s. 

I wanted also to make sure that I have a complete DevOps around the project and test GitHub Actions with it. 

So this was the kind of tasks that I had in mind : 

- [x] create a vitejs based website
- [x] add initial dummy test with vitest 
- [x] create an inital Docker Container
- [x] create an initial Github action that build and run the test. 
- [x] create a simple Calculator project in react website
- [x] update the unit-test to test the created components
- [ ] check deploying the website on GitHub pages or in Azure 
- [ ] ?
